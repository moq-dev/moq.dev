# libmoq + OBS = MoQBS
Oh hey, long time no chat.

As part of the [Montevideo Tech Summer Camp](/blog/monte-video), we worked on an OBS plugin.
I'm here to announce the culmination of that effort... a *temporary* fork of OBS.

## How Do Download?
If you want to build it yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moq-dev/moqbs
cd moqbs
cmake --preset=macos
cmake --build --preset=macos
# Idk I think that's all you need.
```

If you're lazy and want to use pre-built binaries:
- [Mac (ARM)](https://obs.moq.dev/macos/arm64/32.1.0-rc1-35-g98607152d-9860715/moqbs-macos-arm64.dmg)
- [Mac (Intel)](https://obs.moq.dev/macos/x86_64/32.1.0-rc1-35-g98607152d-9860715/moqbs-macos-x86_64.dmg)
- [Linux (x86_64)](https://obs.moq.dev/linux/x86_64/32.1.0-rc1-35-g98607152d-9860715/moqbs-linux-x86_64.deb)
- [Windows (x64)](https://obs.moq.dev/windows/x64/32.0.4-9860715/moqbs-windows-x64.zip)

Claude built these so no promises.
I'm not going to set up a proper CI/CD pipeline because we want to delete this fork as soon as possible.

## Why Do Fork?
The [MoQ OBS plugin](https://github.com/moq-dev/obs) does work with stable OBS... but it's not exposed via the UI.

Seriously, we had to fork OBS just to add a "MoQ" dropdown to the UI.
Go +1 [this PR](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/12911) so the UI becomes dynamic.
Then we can delete the abomination that is `MoQBS`.

## How Do Use?
You can publish to any `moq-relay` server:
- `https://cdn.moq.dev/anon`
- `https://draft-14.cloudflare.mediaoverquic.com`
- `https://localhost:4443/anon` (when using `just dev`)

	<figcaption>Open up the OBS settings. Change `test` to a unique broadcast name and remember that this endpoint is **PUBLIC**.</figcaption>
</figure>

And you can watch from any `moq-relay` server too.
I literally tested this for the first time ever just to take a screenshot.
Huge shoutout to [pangaea](https://github.com/davegullo) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/code) for coding this beast.

	![Watch Page](/blog/moqbs/watch.png)
	<figcaption>Wow it actually works. Note that you won't need the `?jwt` token for the `/anon` endpoint. I'm just lazy and used the `bbb` demo.</figcaption>
</figure>

## What Do Support?
- Codecs: H.264, H.265, OPUS, AAC, AV1
- Transport: [QUIC](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/quic.html), [WebTransport](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/web-transport.html), [WebSocket](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/web-socket.html)
- Versions: [moq-lite](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/moq-lite.html), [moq-transport](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/standard/moq-transport.html) (14+)
- Format: [hang](https://doc.moq.dev/concept/layer/hang.html), CMAF (soon™)

## How Do Work?
If you ever see me writing a C++ implementation of MoQ, shoot.
It's not the real `@kixelated`.

That's why we created [libmoq](https://docs.rs/libmoq/latest/moq/) instead.
It's a C binding on top of the Rust library providing both publish and subscribe functionality.
It basically converts `async` Rust code into a bunch of C callbacks.

You can [download the latest](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/releases) version if you want to give it a try yourself.
The gross async networking stuff is handled by Rust+Tokio in a separate thread, dramatically simplifying the API.
It's a static library so hopefully it just works™.

## What Do Next?
Go forth and use `libmoq` in all of your favorite tools still using C for some reason.
The current API is media-specific, but we're going to add support for generic tracks too.

[Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/) just started on native iOS/Android support for MoQ using libmoq.
It took them a day to get [playback working on iOS](https://discord.com/channels/1124083992740761730/1124083992740761733/1473997800273608744).
Go pay them if you're a big corpo using React Native... or wait until it's open source.

There's also an [ffmpeg fork](https://github.com/brianmed/FFmpeg/tree/feature/moq-integration) if forking OBS was not good enough.
Unfortunately, ffmpeg doesn't have a plugin system so you're stuck with a fork.

If you're bored, vibe code a binding for your favorite language/platform/application and we'll throw it into the `moq-dev` organization.
Bonus points for VLC.

## Who Do Did?
Again a huge shoutout to [pangaea](https://github.com/davegullo), [bpmedley](https://github.com/brianmed), [emilsas](https://github.com/emilsas), and everyone from [Qualabs](https://qualabs.com/) for all of their hard work.
It feels great delegating the hard parts to others.

I could get used to this.
