**Media over QUIC** is a live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement that powers [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)\* and your _favorite_ big tech companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, Cloudflare, etc.

That's right, you no longer need to hack WebRTC!
There's a new way to achieve **real-time latency** in the browser, including contribution and mass distribution via generic CDNs.

		Want a better demo?

		But with more features and cringe layered on top.

### ✨ Features

- 🔓 **Open Source**: Production-ready [Rust and TypeScript libraries](/source).
- 🌐 **100% Web**: Utilizes [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport), [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API), [WebAudio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebAudio_API), WebEtc.
- ⚡ **Real-time**: Minimal latency by skipping less important media during congestion.
- 🚀 **Massive Scale**: Host your own CDN with [moq-relay](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/tree/main/rs/moq-relay) or use [Cloudflare](/blog/first-cdn).
- 🎬 **Multi-Platform**: [Web](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/tree/main/js/hang), [FFmpeg](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/tree/main/rs/hang-cli), [GStreamer](https://github.com/moq-dev/gstreamer), and [native](/source) clients available.
- 🔍 **Discoverable**: Live notifications when broadcasts are published or finish.
- 💪 **Efficient**: No encoding or bandwidth usage until a viewer needs it.
- 🌍 **Compatible**: TCP fallback via [WebSocket](https://github.com/moq-dev/web-transport/tree/main/web-transport-ws), Safari fallback via [libav.js](https://github.com/Yahweasel/libav.js/).
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Hardware accelerated encoding, the rest is in your control.

### *Standards
This website uses a [fork](/blog/transfork) of the IETF draft called [moq-lite](https://moq-dev.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-lite.html) and a media layer called [hang](https://moq-dev.github.io/moq-drafts/draft-lcurley-moq-hang.html).
The principles behind MoQ are fantastic, but standards are **SLOW** and involve too much arguing.
My goal is to build something simple that you can use *now*, even if it's not a standard *yet*.


### Learn More
Check out the [blog](/blog) for more information and a smattering of jokes.
Once you're ready for more, check out the [Github](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq) and/or join [Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr).


Contributions are welcome, of course.
But also feel free to just yoink the code, fork it, and make it your own.
If you're using some flavor of MoQ in the wild, I'd love to hear about it!
