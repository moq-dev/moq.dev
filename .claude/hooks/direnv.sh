# Claude Code inlines $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE into the command string of every Bash
# call, and Linux caps a single argv entry at MAX_ARG_STRLEN, 128KB. This dev
# shell exports around 190KB, so the environment goes in a sidecar file and
# $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE gets only a line sourcing it. macOS has no per-argument cap,
# which is why inlining the whole environment appeared to work there.
